     <p><strong>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 â€“ 6 December 1956)</strong> was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.
     <br><br>
     After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s.[13] He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of the state of India.
     <br><br>
     Ambedkar was trained as an economist, and was a professional economist until 1921, when he became a political leader. He wrote three books on economics: 
    <ul>
        <li>Administration and Finance of the East India Company</li>
        <li>The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India</li>
        <li>The Problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Its Solution</li>
    </ul>
